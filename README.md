<h1>OJ-Submitter</h1>

<p>It is a simple Online Judge Submitter Python Program. I made this project to simplify the process of submitting code to online judges like CodeChef. If I want to submit my solution to any of the CodeChef’s problem, I have to go there problems page, click on submit button, copy and paste code, select the language, again click on submit button and then wait for a while to get the result. And it’s not that I have to do it only once. I the solution was wrong, then I have correct my code and submit it again. <b>I hate it when I have to do the same thing again and again.</b> So one day, I decided to make this program that will do all these steps for me in a single go.</p><br/>

<p><b>Note:</b>Right now, the program only works on CodeChef, but soon I will be updating it to support other Online Judges.</p><br/>

<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p>Once you have cloned the repository to your machine, go to the repositories directory and execute Submitter.py script.</p><br/>
<p>It will ask you for <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> of Codechef.</p><br/>
<p>If username and password are valid, then it will ask for <b>Problem Code</b> and the path to the <b>Solution file(with extension)</b>.</p><br/>
<p>Finally, it will let you <b>choose the language</b> in which you want to submit.</p><br/>
<p>Once all this it entered, it will automatically submit the solution to the Online Judge and will display the output.</p><br/>
